### Hi there 👋

# This GitHub account is getting used less and less. I'll start forking repositories to my self-hosted Gitea instance on https://git.sijanec.eu/.

Sadly, GitHub started annoying me with DMCA takedowns and premium features. It's not free, face it.

So I decided to set up my own Gitea instance on my own server to promote the fact that relying on corporations *sucks*.

For freshest code, visit https://git.šijanec.eu/
