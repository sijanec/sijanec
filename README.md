# I no longer use Github for hosting my repos

I am now selfhosting my personal git service on <http://ni.≈°ijanec.eu./>.

# Za gostovanje repozitorijev Githuba veƒç ne uporabljam

Moja osebna spletna storitev Git je dostopna na <http://ni.≈°ijanec.eu./>.

### Hi there üëã

# This GitHub account is getting used less and less. I'll start forking repositories to my self-hosted Gitea instance on https://git.sijanec.eu/.

Sadly, GitHub started annoying me with DMCA takedowns and premium features. It's not free, face it.

So I decided to set up my own Gitea instance on my own server to promote the fact that relying on corporations *sucks*.

For freshest code, visit https://git.≈°ijanec.eu/
